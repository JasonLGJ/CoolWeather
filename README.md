# CoolWeather
This is a project from the book 'First code for Android', the chapter 14.
After my rivision, there are still many bugs. 
For example, the incompatibility of the support libraries of app.Gradle.
And as the renewal of the weather website "HeWeather", the Gson data from the website will be definitely different.
So the Reception and Translation Classes in the src files of this app should be followed;
Looking forward the future amendment.
